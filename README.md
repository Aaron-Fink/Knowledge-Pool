# The Knowledge Pool #

As an avid Magic the Gathering player and an aspiring Software Engineer I wanted to combine my two favorite hobbies. This application is meant to make finding specific cards incredibly easy. This repository is apart of my journey in the Hack Reactor bootcamp given a time period of 24 hours to complete which is an incredibly daunting task by itself. I had so much fun working on this application and plan to be constantly updating this project in my free time after my time at the bootcamp is complete.

In order to complete work on the project I had to gather all of the information about magic cards from somewhere. Initially I was using the official [Magic the Gathering API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/) however I quickly realized that the image quality was not great when rendered. Due to this, I decided to utilize the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) instead as they have various sized images for each card.
