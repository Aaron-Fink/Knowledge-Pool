# The Knowledge Pool #

As an avid Magic the Gathering player and an aspiring Software Engineer I wanted to combine my two favorite hobbies. This application is meant to make finding specific cards incredibly easy. This project was apart of my journey in the Hack Reactor bootcamp given a time period of 24 hours to complete. An incredibly daunting task by itself. I had so much fun workingon this project and plan to be constantly updating this project in my free time.
